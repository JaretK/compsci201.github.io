####My computer doesn't display the animation smoothly. Is there anything I can do? 

Use StdDraw.show(30) to turn on the animation mode of standard draw. Call it once at the end of each time step, not after each each drawing command.

####Can I combine all the steps from the [Equations Behind NBody](/nbody/1-physics) page into one large for loop?

No! This will simultaneously screw up the physics and make your code harder to understand and debug.

####I draw the planets, but nothing appears on the screen. Why? 

Use [StdDraw.setXscale()](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html#setXscale(double, double)) and [StdDraw.setYscale()](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html#setYscale(double, double)) to change the coordinate system to use the physics coordinates instead of the unit box.

####My planets don't move. 

Make sure that you are using a large enough value of Δt (we specify 25000, but you might want a smaller one when debugging).

####My planets move, but leave images of themselves behind.

Make sure you draw starfield.jpg once per loop before drawing all your planets, instead of once for the entire simulation.

####I'm confused about all of the Δt / 2 terms. Do I need to worry about them to get the physics right? 

No! The update formulas for velocity and position already take this into account. As a technicality, the leapfrog method should be initialized with the velocity at time t = -Δt / 2, so we'll assume this is the value in the input file. In real codes, special care must be made to deal with this.

####I'm a physicist. Why should I use the leapfrog method instead of the formula I derived in high school? 

The leapfrog method is more stable for integrating Hamiltonian systems than conventional numerical methods like Euler's method or Runge-Kutta. The leapfrog method is symplectic, which means it preserves properties specific to Hamiltonian systems (conservation of linear and angular momentum, time-reversibility, and conservation of energy of the discrete Hamiltonian). In contrast, ordinary numerical methods become dissipative and exhibit qualitatively different long-term behavior. For example, the earth would slowly spiral into (or away from) the sun. For these reasons, symplectic methods are extremely popular for N-body calculations in practice. You asked!

####My planets repel each other. Why don't they attract each other? 

Make sure that you get the sign right when you apply Newton's law of gravitation: (x[j] - x[i]) vs. (x[i] - x[j]). Note that Δx and Δy can be positive or negative so do not use Math.abs(). Do not consider changing the universal gravitational constant G to patch your code!

####How should I compute x<sup>2</sup>? 

The simplest way is <code>x*x</code>. In Java, the ^ operator means XOR (not exponentiation).

####How should I compute the square root of x? 

Use [Math.sqrt](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt-double-) or [Math.pow](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#pow-double-double-). The return value of <code>Math.pow(a, b)</code> is a<sup>b</sup>.

####What is Δx? 

It's the change in x-coordinate between two bodies (not between a body at time t and at time t + Δt).

####When I compile NBody.java, it says "cannot resolve symbol StdDraw." Any thoughts? 

Make sure that you import princeton.* and add princeton.jar [to your library build path](http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps004g/fall07/assign/final/shotgun/addlibrary.html).

####What does A.AAAeBB mean?

The notation A.AAAeBB (where A and B are numbers 0-9) is scientific notation for A.AAA * 10<sup>BB</sup>. This is the numerical format found within your planetary system text files. This values can conveniently be parsed in as <code>double</code> values.
